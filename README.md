# face-filter

A simple prototype for a school assignment. This is not an active repo. Just a demo written in python. Using open CV and numpy. 

Install numpy in terminal
```
pip3 install numpy
```

install openCV in terminal
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```

Note! You only need **pip3** if you are on linux or mac, otherwise **pip** is enough.

Look under the instructions to run the program. The file "prototype.ipynb" is a working nootebook ready to be executed.

Example 1 in notebooks are for still images, do not work. Example 2 works for two filters. However, it is still a few buggs with the code. It is a low-fi prototype, therefore is it not any more developing on it. 

## Instructions
- clone repo
- open prototype.ipynb in vscode, jupyter notebook or jupyter lab.
- run all cells from the beginning 
    - insatall following liraries if needed numpy and opencv.
- to exit
    - on mac forece quit
    - on windows force quit
    - on linux force quit
    - (press 'q' to exit do not work as it should)

## Status
- prototype.ipynb: working
- notebooks/example2: working.
- scripts/main.py do not work.
