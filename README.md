# face-filter

A simple prototype for a school assignment. This is not an active repo. Just a demo written in python. Using open CV and numpy. 

Example 1 in notebooks are for still images, do not work. **Example 2** works for two filters. However, it is still a few buggs with the code. It is a low-fi prototype, therefore is it not any more developing on it. 

## Instructions
- clone repo
- run the example 2 
- to exit
    - on mac forece quit
    - on windows force quit
    - on linux force quit
    - (press 'q' to exit do not work as it should)

## Status
- notebooks/example2: working.
- scripts/main.py do not work.
